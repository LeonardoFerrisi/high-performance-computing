# Notes: 

- [r] G.4.P   	Markdown

Need more data, and it should be presented in a markdown table.

- [r] MPI.1.A Point-to-Point Communication (Send/Recv)

This is impressive work - the only flaw is that you are using `time()` rather than `MPI_Wtime()` for your timing data, and the results are sus.  Re-do with larger vectors using proper timing code.

Nice work, but please provide speedup measures rather than absolute "improvement"
