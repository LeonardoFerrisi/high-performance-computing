## Notes

* your code segfaults when run even on small arrays [x]
* no evidence your sort works
* your have printing in your timing code and VERBOSE is hard-coded rather than being a command line argument [x]
* your writeup provides "improvement" in absolute terms, but we really should be measuring speedup instead [x]

Nice work, but I would have liked to see timing of sort on a variety of different arrays.
